            Our mission is to build a smarter, more sustainable world by turning waste into opportunity.
            We connect individuals, businesses, and communities to exchange reusable resources in an efficient,
            environmentally responsible way.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            By facilitating these exchanges, we help reduce landfill waste, lower carbon footprints,
            and promote a circular economy. Whether you’re looking to give away surplus materials or
            find affordable resources, our platform is here to help you make that connection.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Join us in making sustainability a shared effort—one exchange at a time.
